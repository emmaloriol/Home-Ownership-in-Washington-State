# Home-Ownership-in-Washington-State

Homeownership is a big deal. Owning a home builds personal wealth, financial stability, and housing stability. I dove into this fascinating and complicated subject using data from the IPUMS (Integrated Public Use Microdata Series) census. My goal was to shed some light on who's renting and who's owning among married folks in Washington state and why.

I explored various socioeconomic and demographic factors to build support vector models that can predict whether someone's renting or a home-owner. My goal is to lay the groundwork for smarter, more equitable housing policies that could make life a bit more affordable for everyone in Washington state.
